Hello, this is my home page! My name is Isabella Tran and I am a Freshman in computer science, concentration in Cybersecurity, at Cal State Fullerton. My plan is to graduate by the end of Spring 2029.

## My favorite labs from CPSC 120L!

### CPSC 120

* Lab 6, Part 2

    This was a fun lab to do because along with learning how to play a card game which was Blackjack, it was more fun trying to figure out how the number values for aces work. It was confusing at first, and the errors kept on coming but eventually had a small breakthrough for it to actually work. And at the time, it taught me to be patient with my code and not immediately give up with my work. I just kept pushing on. Overall I this lab was one of my favorites because of how tricky it got with the ace part.

* Lab 11, Part 2

    Lab 11, part 2 was a simpler lab but also a fun one as well. The code itself was easier to understand in my opinion as I can tell what the objective was trying to tell me. If a number that is guessed is smaller than my secret number than the code would tell the user the guess is "Too small!", a fun little game that I got to create! It taught me that code can look more simple when you code it out. It sounds complicated but it is not.

* Lab 7, Part 1

    Finally, the parking rules lab was a fun lab to do as well. The lab itself was a little more complicated and precise but overall was a fun lab to work on along with a partner. We quickly figured out how small errors can mess up the code in many ways. But in this lab I got to learn how to properly use operators to indicate whenever this or that should be greater, less than, equal to, and more!
